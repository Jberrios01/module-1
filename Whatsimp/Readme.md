## What is important

I find importance in a lot of things in life, even what other people might 
say aren't that important. A couple key things that is important to me are 
Discipline, Consistency, Loyalty, Trust, and Honesty. Without one of these 
5 things i feel incomplete as a human. 

Discipline: provides people with rules to live their lives efficiently and 
effectively.

Consistency: leads to self-discipline, teaches you self-control, improves 
your overall personality, and builds momentum.

Loyalty: the ability to put others before yourself and stick with them in 
good times and bad.

Trust: its presence cements relationships by allowing people to live and 
work together, feel safe and belong to a group.

Honesty: is the foundation for trust in a relationship, and trust is 
necessary for a relationship to function and thrive.
