##_What is possible_

I believe anything is possible as long as you put your mind and focus on 
whatever it may be you will eventually accomplish it.

Coming from an environment full of dreamers and quiters. I seen the best 
of the best fall and the ones who put the extra work in and stayed focus 
surpass the ones with natural talent's. So as long as you put the work in 
the impossible will turn into possible.

I like to think out the box with this question, and going to let you leave 
with this We are not the only living species in the galaxy.
