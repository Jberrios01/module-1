This root directory contains my Project for module 1.

There are 5 folders and each one has a readme.md answering the following 
5 questions:

1. Who i am

2. Where im going

3. Somethings I know

4. What's possible

5. What's important

The main goal of this module one project/Directory is to display that i 
know how to navigate through the terminal. Also shows that i now know how 
to create, delete, edit, and publish files using the terminal.
