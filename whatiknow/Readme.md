# what i know

I think i know everything but everyday i learn something new. I know that 
this program is going to take me places i can't even imagine as of right 
now. I know the tools and the connections i make in this class will help 
me get started with my professional software engineering career. I know 
everday i walk into this buliding im going to give my peers and myself 
110%.
