##_who am I_

Who am i? is a very difficult question at my age (20 years old). When this
question does come across my mind i like to think of my self like water.I
say this because i am able to adapt to all enviorments. I have experience
many different walks of life and many different cultures. How i am
identfied by the people around me is different than how i view my self.

To my family, friends, and community I am:

1. an athlete
2. a student
3. a leader
4. a king
5. a brother
6. a son
7. a hardworker
8. very ambitious
9. a walking bucket
a go getter
a dreamer
a african-american man
