##_who am I_

Who am i? is a very difficult question at my age (20 years old). When this
question does come across my mind i like to think of my self like water.I
say this because i am able to adapt to all enviorments. I have experience
many different walks of life and many different cultures. How i am
identfied by the people around me is different than how i view my self.

To my family, friends, and community I am:

an athlete
a student
a leader
a king
a brother
a son
a hardworker
very ambitious
a walking bucket
a go getter
a dreamer
a african-american man
