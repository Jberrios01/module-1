## Where I go

I am one who likes to travel and experience new things when i have the 
chance/oppurtunity. I like to think life is all about experiences, the 
person with the most experiences has the most knowledge and can relate to 
many different situations. I am from new haven connecticut, and where i go 
is very important to me. Because in this town where you go and what you 
surround yourself with can either make you or break you. For me 
personally i go where i am loved, welcomed, safe, and (last but not 
least)i go where i am going to grow not shrink!
